# GettingCleaningData

##Course Project

###You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

###Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
###Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
###Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
###Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
###Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Steps to work on this course project

###Download the data source and put into a folder on your local drive and create "UCI HAR Dataset" folder.
###Put run_analysis.R in the parent folder of "UCI HAR Dataset". Your working directory must be the parent folder of "UCI HAR Dataset".
###Run source("run_analysis.R"), then it will generate a new file "tidy.txt" in your working directory.
