# GettingCleaningData

##Course Project

<p>You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.</p>

<li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.</li>
<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.</li>
<li>Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>

##Steps to work on this course project

<li>Download the data source and put into a folder on your local drive and create "UCI HAR Dataset" folder.</li>
<li>Put run_analysis.R in the parent folder of "UCI HAR Dataset". Your working directory must be the parent folder of "UCI HAR Dataset".</li>
<li>Run source("run_analysis.R"), then it will generate a new file "tidy.txt" in your working directory.</li>
